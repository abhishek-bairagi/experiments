      "Content: When a scheduled meeting fails to show up in your calendar, it can disrupt productivity and create confusion. The root of the issue often lies in sync problems between your calendar app and the meeting platform. Start by checking whether your calendar is set to auto-refresh or sync in real-time. If not, force a manual sync.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure that you are logged into the correct account, especially if you use multiple email addresses. Sometimes meetings are scheduled in one calendar but are viewed in another. Also, check for any filters or views that may hide certain event types. For example, in Outlook or Google Calendar, make sure that your calendar list includes the one where the meeting was created.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, verify that you received a calendar invite and accepted it. If not accepted, it may not display depending on your settings. In corporate environments, calendar display issues can stem from permission misconfigurations, so consult your IT team if the problem persists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some browser-based calendar tools may fail to load updates due to browser caching or network issues. Try accessing your calendar from a different browser or device to isolate the problem. Regularly updating your calendar app can also resolve hidden bugs that prevent meetings from displaying.\n",

      "Content: Users on macOS may encounter audio problems during Webex calls due to system sound routing or permissions. First, go to 'System Settings' > 'Sound' and confirm the correct output device (e.g., headphones or speakers) is selected and not muted. Also, check 'Input' settings to ensure your microphone is correctly recognized. Navigate to 'System Settings' > 'Privacy & Security' > 'Microphone' to ensure Webex is granted access. For Bluetooth devices, confirm that they are connected and set as the default device. Sometimes, restarting the 'coreaudiod' process via Terminal using 'sudo killall coreaudiod' can restore audio. Additionally, ensure macOS is up-to-date and check for Webex app updates. If using a browser version of Webex, ensure microphone and speaker access is granted via browser permissions. If the issue persists, reinstall Webex and verify sound settings again.\n",

First, open Webex and navigate to 'Audio Settings' before joining a call to test your speaker and microphone. Ensure the correct devices are selected. During calls, use the in-call device selector to switch output/input devices as needed. Check whether Webex has permission to access microphone and speaker resources in your operating system settings. If using headphones or Bluetooth devices, connect them before launching Webex. In some cases, corrupted Webex cache files can interfere with audio—clearing the app cache or reinstalling can help. Lastly, network issues or firewalls may block audio ports; verify that the required UDP ports (e.g., 5004, 33434-33598) are not blocked.

      "1.  **Check Webex Audio Settings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   Open Webex and go to 'Audio Settings' *before* joining a call.\n",
      "    *   Test your speaker and microphone to ensure they are working within the app.\n",
      "    *   Make sure the correct speaker/output device is selected.\n",
      "    *   During a call, use the in-call device selector to switch between available output devices if necessary (article28).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Operating System Permissions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   Verify that Webex has permission to access your microphone and speaker within your Windows system settings (article28).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Headphones/Bluetooth Devices:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   If you're using headphones or Bluetooth devices, connect them *before* launching Webex (article28).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Webex App Cache:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   Corrupted Webex cache files can sometimes cause audio problems. Try clearing the app cache or reinstalling Webex (article28).\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Network and Firewall:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   Network issues or firewalls can block audio ports. Make sure the necessary UDP ports (e.g., 5004, 33434-33598) are not blocked (article28).\n",

    "\"content\": \"If you're experiencing problems when trying to schedule a meeting, there are several possible causes and corresponding solutions. First, check your calendar permissions. If your calendar is shared or connected to another service (like Outlook or Google Calendar), ensure that you have the proper permissions to create events. In some cases, meeting scheduling may fail due to sync delays or outdated calendar tokens.\\n\\nAnother common issue involves time zone mismatches between participants. Always confirm that all participants' calendars are set to the correct time zone. Additionally, browser extensions or security software can sometimes block the scripts required to render the scheduling interface.\\n\\nClear your browser's cache and cookies, or try scheduling the meeting in a different browser or in incognito/private mode. If you're using a third-party scheduling tool, ensure it’s properly integrated with your primary calendar service.\\n\\nAlso check if the service’s backend (such as the scheduling API or cloud calendar service) is currently facing any outages. You can usually find this information on the service status page. If the issue persists, reach out to your IT admin to verify there are no policy restrictions on your account preventing scheduling actions.\",\n",
