      "Content: Experiencing silence during calls can be frustrating, especially when everything appears connected properly. This issue may stem from muted system settings, disconnected audio devices, or app-specific configurations. Start by verifying the output device in your system’s sound settings and ensure that the correct speaker or headset is selected. Check the application’s in-call audio settings to confirm that the correct output is assigned. Also, inspect the volume mixer to make sure the communication app isn’t muted. If using Bluetooth devices, ensure they are paired and actively connected. Occasionally, audio services on the operating system may crash—restarting the system or the audio service can resolve this. It's also advisable to update audio drivers or roll back recent updates if the problem began suddenly. If none of these steps resolve the issue, consult IT support or reinstall the calling application.\n",

If you’re not receiving notifications, first check the system settings to ensure they’re enabled for the relevant app. Make sure Do Not Disturb mode or Focus Mode isn't active. On mobile devices, battery optimization settings may prevent apps from running in the background—disable this for critical apps. In the app itself, ensure that notification permissions are granted and that notification types (e.g., push, email, in-app) are correctly configured. Sometimes, app updates can reset preferences, so recheck settings after an update. On desktop systems, verify that notification banners or sounds are not disabled.

To regain control, start by customizing your notification preferences under Settings > Notifications. You can choose to be notified only for direct messages, mentions, or nothing at all. For individual channels, click the channel name, select 'Notifications', and fine-tune alerts based on priority. Muting low-priority channels can help reduce noise without leaving the group. Additionally, set up Do Not Disturb hours to pause notifications during specific times. If you're receiving alerts from Slack apps or bots, check their individual settings to adjust frequency or disable them altogether. For mobile users, Slack allows separate notification rules from desktop, so be sure to configure both. Finally, consider using keywords to trigger alerts only when truly relevant. By optimizing these settings, you can make Slack a more manageable and productive communication tool.\n",

First, open Webex and navigate to 'Audio Settings' before joining a call to test your speaker and microphone. Ensure the correct devices are selected. During calls, use the in-call device selector to switch output/input devices as needed. Check whether Webex has permission to access microphone and speaker resources in your operating system settings. If using headphones or Bluetooth devices, connect them before launching Webex. In some cases, corrupted Webex cache files can interfere with audio—clearing the app cache or reinstalling can help. Lastly, network issues or firewalls may block audio ports; verify that the required UDP ports (e.g., 5004, 33434-33598) are not blocked. Contact support if issues continue despite following these steps.\n",

      "Content: Users on macOS may encounter audio problems during Webex calls due to system sound routing or permissions. First, go to 'System Settings' > 'Sound' and confirm the correct output device (e.g., headphones or speakers) is selected and not muted. Also, check 'Input' settings to ensure your microphone is correctly recognized. Navigate to 'System Settings' > 'Privacy & Security' > 'Microphone' to ensure Webex is granted access. For Bluetooth devices, confirm that they are connected and set as the default device. Sometimes, restarting the 'coreaudiod' process via Terminal using 'sudo killall coreaudiod' can restore audio. Additionally, ensure macOS is up-to-date and check for Webex app updates. If using a browser version of Webex, ensure microphone and speaker access is granted via browser permissions. If the issue persists, reinstall Webex and verify sound settings again.\n",

      "Title: Troubleshooting No Sound During Meetings in Windows\n",
      "Content: Experiencing silence during calls can be frustrating, especially when everything appears connected properly. This issue may stem from muted system settings, disconnected audio devices, or app-specific configurations. Start by verifying the output device in your system’s sound settings and ensure that the correct speaker or headset is selected. Check the application’s in-call audio settings to confirm that the correct output is assigned. Also, inspect the volume mixer to make sure the communication app isn’t muted. If using Bluetooth devices, ensure they are paired and actively connected. Occasionally, audio services on the operating system may crash—restarting the system or the audio service can resolve this. It's also advisable to update audio drivers or roll back recent updates if the problem began suddenly. If none of these steps resolve the issue, consult IT support or reinstall the calling application.\n",
